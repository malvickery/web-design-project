            <p id="quotes">Be crazy enough to know you can do anything you want in this life.</p>
            <p id="aboutpOne">
                Hi! I'm Mal! I am a 20-something, close,but almost at the big 3-0 web design student at Fanshawe College. I took the terrifying plunge into mature studenthood in January 2018 and boy was it a crazy one! I've got one, and almost 2 semesters under my belt and my expected graduation is May 2019. I have got a previous diploma from Fanshawe College in Business Accounting, however that was never my passion, so that is what brought me to where I am now, along with many other speed bumps along the way. The quotes seen here are the words I live my life by. They are what drove me to take the plunge to go back to school and what will help me take the plunge into entrepreunuership in the future. </p>
            <p id="quotes">Find your tribe, and love them hard.</p>
            <p id="aboutpOne">
                I am married to the most amazing person. He has been my rock for almost a decade now and I cannot imagine life without him. We have been on many ups and downs in the last decade, but it changes you and molds you into the person you are now. We have celebrated our success and grieved our losses and failures together. We have two doggos and two cats that we just adopted in March. These animals are also my rocks. I am surrounded by a loving family whom I cherish with all my heart. If you know me well, you know I keep to myself and am very much the introvert, that being said, my best friend is and will be my best friend for life. I would take a great group of quarters over a hundred medicore pennies anyday. If you want anyone in this life, make sure you can say that this is how you chose to build your tribe.
            </p>
            <p id="quotes">I am constantly in pain. Yes, constantly. Every. Single. Second. The pain is still there when I'm smiling. The pain is still there when I don't talk about it. When I say "I'm Fine" I have a very different definition than you do.</p>
            <p id="aboutpOne">
                I married my husband in August of 2012, and in Febuary of 2013, our lives would take a turn in course and put us on a path to a life we never thought would happen. Who knew 6 months into marriage, the universe would put us on the path to the greatest test of all.
                <br><br> 
                In February of 2013, we were in a car accident that would alter our lives for years to come. As we tried to heal that year, who knew that 11 months later the universe would rear its ugly head again and throw a new challenge. 
                <br><br>
                We run a skiing program for kids with disabilities, and in January of 2014 I was on my way to the hill from Lambeth when the world decided one car accident wasn't enough in a year, hell let's throw a second one in there and see how she handles it.
            </p>
               <p id="quotes">My pain isn't who I am but it controls what I can do, and in this world, what you can do is a huge measure of who you are ...</p>
               <p id="aboutpOne">
                Since those two accidents, I have been battling a never ending battle with chronic pain and Fibromyalgia, and before you say but those are the same thing, I thought that as well, until I came to find out they werent at all. I have gone 5 years without a firm diagnosis and it is tiring being in pain like this. But as a strong willed, stubborn ass, I am stronger than my disease and when my job became to taxing, I made the decision to return to school, which brings us to where I am now.
                <br><br>
                My journey with chronic illness has made me see that I want to be a beacon of hope to those fighting an invisible battle that no one but you sees. It has made me who I am today, it has made me rethink my life, my health and has led me down the road to finding myself more than I ever thought I could achieve in this lifetime.
